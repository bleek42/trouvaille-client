/* SASS CONFIG
* ! variables can be declared and used with '$'-- kinda like jQuery !!!
* ! @import '../path/to/_config.scss' to import all the functions and vars mixins and whatever else is put in here !
* ! @mixins are sass functions ! use @include statement to apply them to the elements you are styling, just as you would any normall CSS property !
* ! EXAMPLE *

* $my-color: black;
* $my-display: flex;

* @mixin set-display($display) {
    
}
